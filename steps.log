Prepare the Raspberry Pi:
    1. Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed on the Raspberry Pi.
    2. Ensure that the Raspberry Pi is connected to the same local network as your development machine (for easier deployment and testing).
Transfer the Project Files:
    1. You can either transfer the project files to the Raspberry Pi or use Docker images to directly pull them onto the Raspberry Pi.
    2. A convenient way is to build your images locally, push them to a Docker registry (such as Docker Hub), and then pull them onto the Raspberry Pi.
Run Docker Compose on Raspberry Pi:
    1. Use the docker-compose.yml file to start the entire stack.
    2. You may need to make slight adjustments, especially if there are changes in networking (such as IP addresses).

Test the Setup:
    1. Access the frontend endpoint via your Raspberry Pi's IP address from other devices on your network.
